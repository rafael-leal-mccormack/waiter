Here's a comprehensive summary of all the improvements we discussed:

1. Server Architecture & Code Organization
✅ Completed: Refactored monolithic server.ts into modular structure
server/plugins.ts - Plugin registration
server/http.ts - HTTP routes
server/websocket.ts - WebSocket handling
server/shutdown.ts - Graceful shutdown
server/types.ts - Shared types

2. Database Design & Data Storage
Core Tables Needed:
Call Sessions: Track call metadata, duration, status
Conversations: Store user/assistant interactions
Tool Executions: Log AI tool calls and results
Reservations: Booking data (if implementing booking)
Customer Profiles: Returning customer data
Call Metrics: Analytics and performance data
Menu Items: Restaurant menu with translations
Recordings: Call audio files (if implementing recording)

3. Call Recording Implementation
Features:
Enable recording via Twilio TwiML or API
Store recordings in Supabase Storage or AWS S3
Webhook handlers for recording status
Database schema for recording metadata
Storage Options:
Supabase Storage: Good for small-medium scale, integrated
AWS S3: Better for large scale, more control
Costs: ~$1-25/month depending on volume and provider

4. Multi-Language Support (English & Spanish)
Components:
Language Detection: Using AI to detect user's language
Voice Models: Language-specific ElevenLabs voices
Translated Prompts: System prompts in both languages
Menu Translations: Bilingual menu items
Fallback Responses: Error messages in both languages

5. Caching Strategy
Audio Caching:
Memory Cache: Fastest access for frequently used audio
Redis Cache: Persistent storage for audio files
Common Phrases: Pre-generate frequently used responses
Cache Keys: Based on text, language, and voice ID
Other Caching:
Language Detection: Cache detected languages
Menu Items: Cache menu data with translations
Cache Management: Warmup, invalidation, monitoring
Benefits:
Cost Reduction: 90%+ savings on ElevenLabs API calls
Performance: 2-3s → 10-50ms response times
Scalability: Better handling of traffic spikes

6. Error Handling & Resilience
Improvements Made:
✅ Graceful Shutdown: Proper cleanup of all connections
✅ Connection Timeouts: Auto-close stale connections
✅ Error Recovery: Fallback responses for failed operations
Additional Improvements Needed:
Retry Logic: For failed API calls
Circuit Breakers: Prevent cascade failures
Health Checks: Monitor service health
Alerting: Notify on critical failures

7. Performance Optimizations
Audio Streaming:
Chunked Audio: Send audio in smaller chunks (4KB)
Parallel Processing: Handle multiple calls concurrently
Connection Pooling: Reuse connections where possible
Database:
Indexing: Optimize queries with proper indexes
Connection Pooling: Efficient database connections
Query Optimization: Minimize database calls

8. Monitoring & Analytics
Metrics to Track:
Call Performance: Duration, success rates, error rates
AI Performance: Response times, tool execution success
Audio Quality: Generation times, cache hit rates
User Experience: Language preferences, common queries
Tools:
Logging: Structured logging with correlation IDs
Metrics: Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
Tracing: Distributed tracing for debugging

9. Security & Privacy
Considerations:
Data Encryption: Encrypt stored recordings and data
Access Control: Secure API endpoints
Privacy Compliance: GDPR, CCPA compliance
Audit Logging: Track data access and changes

10. Scalability Improvements
Horizontal Scaling:
Load Balancing: Distribute calls across multiple servers
State Management: Redis for shared state
Database Scaling: Read replicas, sharding
CDN: For audio file delivery

11. Feature Enhancements
Voice Features:
Voice Selection: Multiple voice options per language
Emotion Detection: Adjust voice based on user emotion
Background Noise: Noise reduction and echo cancellation
AI Features:
Conversation Memory: Remember previous interactions
Personalization: Learn user preferences
Intent Recognition: Better understanding of user goals

12. Testing & Quality Assurance
Testing Strategy:
Unit Tests: Individual component testing
Integration Tests: End-to-end call flow testing
Load Testing: Performance under high traffic
Voice Testing: Audio quality and accuracy testing
